# üí° **Gatherers-Legacy**

This project, started and largely completed during my school reading week near the end of 2010, was born out of my passion for video games, especially the resource gathering mechanic of *StarCraft*. So, I built my own version of it.

Initially created using [Dev-C++](https://www.bloodshed.net/) with the MinGW compiler, I've since ported it to run with VS Code and the C/C++ extensions. It still runs smoothly, even on modern versions of Windows and Ubuntu (Wine).

## üîπ **Key Features**

- **Time-based Update Loop**  
  Smooth and consistent behavior across systems, using a time-delta (tick-based) update approach.

- **Custom Engine with Animation Support**  
  Built from scratch to manage entity states, movement, rendering, and basic AI, with sprite animations and fluid state transitions.

- **Classic Blending with Bitmap Masks**  
  Implements retro-style transparency using manually crafted bitmap masks for a rasterized software-rendered look.

- **State-based AI System**  
  Workers transition between states like *seeking*, *gathering*, and *returning*, emulating early RTS gatherer logic.

- **Old-school Raycast Pathfinding**  
  Uses line-of-sight raycasting to determine clear paths, skipping obstacles when possible.

- **Map Scrolling**  
  Supports camera panning to utilize the entire map.

- **Minimap Display**  
  A compact overview of the world space, showing unit positions, buildings, and resource locations at a glance.

- **Text Blittering System**  
  Custom-built text renderer using bitmap fonts, used for in-game UI and overlays.
  
## üîπ **A Bit of History**

Built with a barebones IDE and barely any debugging tools, the project ran mostly on caffeine and sheer determination. After a few proof-of-concept trials in C++ ([Workers](https://github.com/Broosky/Workers)), I decided to write it in pure C. Though this version isn't fully optimized, it holds a special place in my development journey.

I didn't have source control at the time, so I took snapshots of the repository (directory) at certain milestones. Hence, the V10.0 ‚ò∫Ô∏è

This repository has been renamed **Gatherers-Legacy** to preserve its sentimental value. A new repo, [Gatherers](https://github.com/Broosky/Gatherers), will supersede it, which I'll continue to improve it when time allows.

## üîπ **Ubuntu Instructions**

To build the project on Ubuntu, you'll need to install the MinGW cross-compiler, Visual Studio Code, and Wine to run Windows executables on Linux. Then, compile with either the **i686-w64-mingw32** or **x86_64-w64-mingw32 toolchains**, and run the executable via **Wine**.

## üîπ **Windows Instructions**

Install **MSYS2** on your C drive (following the [official guide](https://www.msys2.org/)), and then follow the steps for compiling with MinGW from the MSYS2 terminal, or use the Visual Studio Code toolchains.
